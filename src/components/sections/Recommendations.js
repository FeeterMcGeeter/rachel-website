                    Having had the opportunity to work closely with Rachel for
                    more than two years, I can say without hesitation that she
                    stands out among the broader DSS team with her willingness
                    to remain curious and to bring forth ideas that make all of
                    us more effective and more efficient. Her natural abilities
                    to think strategically and to challenge the status-quo are
                    an asset to the DSS team and make her capable of leading any
                    DSS initiative. I have also witnessed firsthand the respect
                    that Rachel's expertise commands on the Blue Sky Region
                    floor. No matter whether the focus is on supply chains,
                    e-commerce, international shipping, or FedEx resources,
                    Rachel brings a wealth of knowledge to the DSMs and AEs that
                    depend on her. The true impact of her new-hire education
                    initiative is likely underappreciated and certain to be
                    long-lasting.

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    In a more personal capacity, Rachel has not been shy showing
                    her enthusiasm for helping others. Particularly those in
                    need. It becomes most apparent each December as she leads
                    the Blue Sky Region's involvement with the Angel Tree
                    project. The energy she puts into it permeates the Blue Sky
                    Region with a deep sense of gratitude. Being part of that
                    each year is one of the highlights for me, personally.
                </p>

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    I will continue to expect great things from Rachel and look
                    forward to working with her for many more years to come at
                    FedEx!
                </p>

                    I would like to endorse Rachel Davis as your next Senior Strategic Digital Sales Specialist.  She has displayed perseverance in a number of ways - all of which have enabled her internal customers, BSI Account Executives, to succeed in closing new business.
                </p>

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    Rachel's commitment to improving the BSI new hire experience has paid off across the organization.  Her ability to connect the dots with our brand new Account Executives gives them a better launching point to their sales success, and her creativity and organization in developing the content keeps the AEs inspired, engaged, and on track when taking in the education she and the DSS team members provide.
                </p>

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    Peer leadership is an incredibly effective tool, yet not everyone is willing to put themselves on the line to hold others accountable.  That is not the case with Rachel.  She is willing to speak up for what is right and fair in DSS, BSI, and FedEx, which is in keeping with the FedEx focus on personal accountability.
                </p>

                <p className='one-letter mb-sm'>
                    Rachel has shown herself to be a valuable asset and as a Senior Strategic Digital Sales Specialist, she will undoubtedly continue to serve her internal and external customers for the success of the organization.

                    Since I started at FedEx in early 2019, Rachel has been a beacon of knowledge to help me grow as an AE. Not only did she seem to handle her daily job responsibilities, but she also took the initiative to help me and so many others as a new hire. Rachel was responsible for building a new hire program that gave me the foundational tools to help me become a better AE. I believe Rachel is wonderful at her role because she takes time to truly help all team members and cares about delivering the FedEx promise. I believe Rachel will continue to do very well in any role with FedEx while also elevating other team members due to her natural sense of leadership and teaching skills.
